Reading this blogpost, you will have a deeper insight into the intuitions behind the use cases of multi-scale convolutional feature maps in the recent proposed CNN architectures for variety of vision tasks. Therefore, this blogpost can be treated as a tutorial to learn more about how different types of layers impact the spatial scales and receptive fields of feature maps. Also, this blogpost is for those engineers and researchers that are involved in designing CNN architectures and are tired of blind trial and error of which feature maps to choose from a CNN backbone to improve the performance of their models, and instead, prefer from the early steps of design process, to match the spatial scale profiles of feature maps with the object dimensions in training datasets.
